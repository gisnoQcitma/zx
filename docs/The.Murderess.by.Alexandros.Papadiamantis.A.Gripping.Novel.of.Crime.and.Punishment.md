*The Murderess* was first published in 1903 and is considered one of Papadiamantis' masterpieces. The author was a prolific writer of novels, short stories, and literary sketches, often set in his native island of Skiathos or in Athens, where he lived most of his life. He is widely regarded as the founder of modern Greek fiction and a precursor of magical realism. His style combines realistic detail with poetic imagery and symbolism, creating a powerful and unique voice.

You can also read a sample of the book online from Google Books[^1^] or Scribd[^2^]. Whichever format you choose, you will not regret diving into this dark and fascinating novel that explores the themes of gender, violence, morality, and justice.
  
One of the most striking aspects of *The Murderess* is the way Papadiamantis portrays the harsh realities of life in rural Greece in the late nineteenth century, especially for women. Hadoula is a complex and tragic character, who acts out of a twisted sense of compassion and rebellion against the patriarchal society that oppresses her and her daughters. She sees no hope or happiness for the female children she kills, only poverty, hardship, and abuse. She also resents the men who exploit and dominate women, and who view them as inferior and disposable.
 
However, Hadoula is not a hero or a martyr, but a criminal and a sinner. Her actions are not justified or excused by the author, but rather exposed and condemned. Papadiamantis does not shy away from depicting the horror and cruelty of Hadoula's murders, and the suffering and grief they cause to the families and the community. He also shows how Hadoula's conscience torments her, and how she is eventually caught and punished by the law. The novel does not offer a simple or easy solution to the social and moral problems it raises, but rather invites the reader to reflect and question.
 
*The Murderess* is a novel that will stay with you long after you finish reading it. It is a work of art that transcends its time and place, and speaks to universal human issues. It is also a testament to the genius and talent of Alexandros Papadiamantis, one of the greatest writers of modern Greek literature. If you are looking for a book that will challenge and inspire you, you should definitely give *The Murderess* a try.
