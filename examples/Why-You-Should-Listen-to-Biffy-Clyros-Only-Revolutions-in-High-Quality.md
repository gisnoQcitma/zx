Why does quality matter? Well, because Only Revolutions is a rich and complex album that deserves to be heard in all its glory. The band worked with producer Garth Richardson and recorded with a full orchestra, adding layers of depth and texture to their sound. The album also features guest appearances from Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and a brass section on some tracks. Listening to Only Revolutions in low quality would mean missing out on many of these details and nuances that make the album so special.
 
Only Revolutions is also an album that demands your attention and involvement. The songs are not only catchy, but also dynamic and unpredictable. They change tempo, mood and style frequently, keeping you on your toes and engaged. The lyrics are also clever and witty, often using wordplay and metaphors to convey the band's views on life, love, God and horses. Yes, horses. You'll have to listen to find out why.
 
Some of the highlights of Only Revolutions include The Captain, a bombastic opener with marching drums and horns; Bubbles, a soaring rocker with a killer guitar riff and a guest solo from Homme; God & Satan, a tender ballad that explores the duality of human nature; Many of Horror, a powerful anthem that was later covered by X Factor winner Matt Cardle; and Mountains, a triumphant single that charted at number five in the UK.
